# Feature-based-classification-of-bacteria-shapes-Kaggle-Competition
A Kaggle Data Science Competition in which the winners were decided on the basis of the highest F1 score. A  dataset based on certain features of bacteria was given and we had to perform classification of different types of bacteria. My team was in the top 10 of the results. We implemented the Random Forest Model and got an f1 score of 0.88200.
